>this is so i can sort things out a little better.
>i don’t really know what to say though. ive never had a diary or a journal
>my therapist tried a while ago but i don’t uh
>i don’t think im very smart or very good at articulating
>i have to be better though so this is me trying! 
>um
>to start
>stan died
>it still makes me nauseous to write or think about but i cant tell the others
>not yet at least
>or at least not if i wanna do this
>me and kenny decided that i will go forward to scope out the server for a little while before i come back to before when stan died
>i cant tell the others because wendy might get it but i dont think craig or heather will
>im afraid theyll hate me or things will fall apart before we get in there
>so i have to wait
>im afraid of a lot of things actually
>im going to list them so i can ‘acknowledge them ad try and accept them’
>i wont be able to go back enough to save stan
>the others will find out and things will fall apart and well all die
>the others find out and things work out but they think im evil and heartless and they hate me
>but none of that is going to happen! 
>this is my choice and im sticking to it
>kenny said i should go back if im not comfortable or i cant do it but he was right and i can so i will! 
>and i am not second guessing anything at all!!!!! 
>im going to do my best
